/*
 * written because people could not do real time
 * FM demod on Atom hardware with GNU radio
 * based on rtl_sdr.c and rtl_tcp.c
 *
 * lots of locks, but that is okay
 * (no many-to-many locks)
 *
 * todo:
 *       sanity checks
 *       scale squelch to other input parameters
 *       test all the demodulations
 *       pad output on hop
 *       frequency ranges could be stored better
 *       scaled AM demod amplification
 *       auto-hop after time limit
 *       peak detector to tune onto stronger signals
 *       fifo for active hop frequency
 *       clips
 *       noise squelch
 *       merge stereo patch
 *       merge soft agc patch
 *       merge udp patch
 *       testmode to detect overruns
 *       watchdog to reset bad dongle
 *       fix oversampling
