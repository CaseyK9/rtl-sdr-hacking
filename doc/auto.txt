Notes from (coming in late) auto-detecting signals using SDR:
(TODO: get the talk from youtube from defcon wifi hut 2015?)

* auto-detecting psk, bpsk, qpsk?
  - raising FFT results to the power of 2, 4, etc
  - .. why?

  - eg - raise to power of 4, see two peaks - QPSK

* decimation?

* mixing signals in software to get things back down
  to baseband?

* clock drift?

Baud rate:

* baud rate - related to the distance between the outer peaks
  and DC

* multiply the signal with a single sample delayed version,
  discard phase info, take FFT of this, look at peak - first peak
  is the baud rate.

  (Why?)

* "cyclo-stationary analysis"

* converting the fft bin number back to the baud rate - remember,
  the fft is on a sample at a certain rate / size, so we have to
  calculate it back to the baud rate.

clock recovery?

* without it, you end up with constellation plots which hvae things
  in the centre

* need to figure out how to sync the sample rate so we sample at
  high signal amplitudes

* "kostas / costas loop?" - frequency locking, results in removing
  extra frequency components

Ok, so now we have a stream of bits - now what?

* the stream may be covolution coded, whitened to distribute the
  power across the spectrum, other FEC, etc.

* You don't know if the transmitter / receiver is synced or not -
  eg if it's rotated 90 degrees, inverted, flipped (conjugated), etc.
* .. so you typically have a preamble that the receiver synchronises
  against and can used pre-computed combinations to find the highest
  correlation and thus return the transform to use.

* .. ok, so how do we abuse viterbi to do this on the receive side?
* .. you modify the decoder (eg CC-SDS in gnuradio - hard-coded to the
  "voyager" FEC parameters) so you get the output bits and the "path metric"
 - ie, how well the decoder is actually doing
 - path metric of zero - "best" - it mapped through a perfect path
   through the receive trellis decoder

 So then you modify something to try all the combinations and feeds
 it into viterbi to see what the path metrics are.
 - conjugation
 - phase rotation
 - inversion
 - delay (in the viterbi samples?)

 This is the "auto-fec" block.

Ok, now we have a reconstructed stream of bits, now what?

(My questions):
  - how'd he figure out what the FEC coding length was?
  - he used the voyager convolutional code

Here - there's likely a scrambler distributing the signal.
  - additive scrambler
  - multiplicative scrambler

  eg: iess308 scrambler - popular in satellite communications

Next - you saw structure - but you're seeing long strings of zeros and
long strings of ones.  You're onto something, but you need another
transform.

eg - differentially decode?
what program was he using?
